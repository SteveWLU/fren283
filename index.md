This course retraces the evolution of thought in France across centuries through the examination of intellectual, cultural and artistic movements. In readings and discussions, we explore how ideas like language, national identity, gender, human rights, and scientific advancement have developed to form the framework of modern francophone societies. A primary objective through the study of the history of ideas is to provide ample opportunity to continue building proficiency in French. For this reason, all readings, discussions and assignments are in French (HU). Prerequisites: FREN 162, 164, or equivalency. FREN 261 recommended.
